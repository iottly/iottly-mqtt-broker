# =================================================================
# General configuration
# =================================================================

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages currently inflight per 
# client.
# This includes messages that are partway through handshakes and 
# those that are being retried. Defaults to 20. Set to 0 for no 
# maximum. Setting to 1 will guarantee in-order delivery of QoS 1 
# and 2 messages.
max_inflight_messages 1

# =================================================================
# Default listener
# =================================================================
# Note that if the broker is running as a Windows service it will default to
# "log_dest none" and neither stdout nor stderr logging is available.
# Use "log_dest none" if you wish to disable logging.
log_dest stdout

# =================================================================
# Security
# =================================================================

# Boolean value that determines whether clients that connect 
# without providing a username are allowed to connect. If set to 
# false then a password file should be created (see the 
# password_file option) to control authenticated client access. 
# Defaults to true.
allow_anonymous true

# =================================================================
# Bridges
# =================================================================

# bridges are configured via dinamically generated 
# /mosquitto/bridge-config/bridge.conf file

# =================================================================
# External config files
# =================================================================

# External configuration files may be included by using the 
# include_dir option. This defines a directory that will be searched
# for config files. All files that end in '.conf' will be loaded as
# a configuration file. It is best to have this as the last option
# in the main file. This option will only be processed from the main
# configuration file. The directory specified must not contain the 
# main configuration file.
